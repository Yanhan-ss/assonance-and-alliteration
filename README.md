# assonance-and-alliteration
The generator is built based on the existing model bygpt5 https://github.com/potamides/uniformers. The original model can rhyme and follow meter constraints very well, but it does not have a good level of alliteration. We created a new generator that aims to generate poetry that contains rhymes, a high level of assonance, and a high level of alliteration. 
Another file shows the code for fine-tuning gpt2 model on a large poetry dataset.
